# 🧩 Unity Mesh Explosion & Reconstruction – DOTS + Rayfire Showcase

A **Unity 6 showcase project** that demonstrates a **visually satisfying explosion and reconstruction effect** using:

- 🧱 **Rayfire** for dynamic mesh fragmentation  
- ⚙️ **DOTS/ECS** for high-performance entity and physics management  
- ⏱️ **Custom time control** to pause, resume, or rewind the simulation

## 🚀 Features

### 💥 Mesh Explosion
Break any 3D mesh or structure into realistic pieces using **Rayfire**, and explode them outward using **physics-based forces** or custom motion.

### 🔁 Reconstruction
Watch as the fragments **return to their original positions**, physically animating to reconstruct the mesh — piece by piece, frame by frame.

### ⏸️ Pause & Rewind
Control time during the explosion:
- ⏸️ **Pause**: Freeze fragments mid-air  
- ▶️ **Resume**: Continue the explosion forward  
- ⏮️ **Rewind**: Retrace steps back to the original shape
